# Trial task for python developer

In this trial task, you are asked to create an application that provides a simple create-and-retrieve interface for a cars inventory. The application is required to be designed using any python web framework of your choice (e.g. Flask, Django, etc.). The application must feature an endpoint that represents a paged sorted list of cars (total number of cars in the inventory might exceed 10000 items). Besides that, the application must provide an endpoint that allows to add a new car into the inventory.

Please use the data dump provided within the repository to have a reference of the application's domain model.

Your submission must contain the following artifacts besides the application code:

* A test suite
* A Dockerfile descriptor
* docker-compose.yml descriptor that would allow to run the application locally

Please consider using PostgreSQL as the database engine. You are free to alter database schema as you need - adding indices, triggers, functions, etc.

# Submission delivery

Please fork this repository and create a pull request once your submission is ready.
